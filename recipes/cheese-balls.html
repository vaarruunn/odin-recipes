     <h2>These delicious crispy potato cheese balls make an awesome party snack.</h2>

    <p>These are flavorful, addictive and will be loved by kids and grown ups alike. Cheese balls can be made in many different ways. The recipe shared here is super quick to make and the cheese balls can be deep fried, pan fried or even baked.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Gram Flour </li>
        <li>chickpea flour </li>
        <li>2 Potatoes </li>
        <li>½ cup grated Cheese </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves </li>
        <li> ½ teaspoon cumin powder</li>
        <li> ½ teaspoon kosher salt </li>
        <li> ⅓ teaspoon black pepper powder </li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Boil 3 small potatoes (100 grams) in a steamer, pressure cooker or an electric cooker until they are fork tender. You can also steam the potatoes in an Instant Pot for 7 to 8 minutes. Boil the potatoes until they are completely cooked, then drain them well.</li>
    <li>When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel them and mash very well in a mixing bowl. There should be no moisture while peeling, chopping and mashing the potatoes. Allow the potatoes to come at room temperature before you add the remaining ingredients.r</li>
    <li> Grate 60 grams cheese and set aside. 60 grams equals about ½ cup tightly packed grated cheese. You can use either cheddar cheese or processed cheese. If using Amul processed cheese cubes, 3 cubes is sufficient.</li>
    <li>To the mashed potatoes, add ¼ to ⅓ teaspoon black pepper powder, ½ teaspoon cumin powder, a pinch of garam masala (optional) and 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves (cilantro) or parsley leaves.</li>
    <li>Add 4 tablespoons gram flour (besan) or chickpea flour. I highly recommend using gram flour or chickpea flour, however if you do not have it you can also add 3 to 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour, corn starch or arrowroot flour.</li>
    <li>Mix very well.</li>
    <li>Then add the grated cheese and two to three pinches of black salt. Since the cheese already has salt in it, add salt with caution and taste as you go. You can add edible rock salt or regular salt instead of black salt.</li>
    <li>Then add the grated cheese and two to three pinches of black salt. Since the cheese already has salt in it, add salt with caution and taste as you go. You can add edible rock salt or regular salt instead of black salt.</li>
    <li>Mix the cheese with the rest of the potato mixture very well. Check the taste and add more salt or crushed black pepper if required.</li>
    <li>Make small balls from the mixture, including one tiny ball to test while frying.</li>
    <li>Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai (wok) or pan. You can use any neutral oil with a high smoking point.</li>
    <li>When the oil becomes hot, add the tiny tester cheese ball. The temperature of oil can be from 180 to 190 degrees Celsius (356 to 375 degrees Fahrenheit). The oil has to be hot, otherwise, the cheese balls may break.</li>
    <li>Working in batches, fry the remaining cheese balls. Do not overcrowd. Since I used a small kadai (wok), I added four cheese balls at a time.
    <li>Serve Cheese Balls hot with dipping sauces like tomato ketchup, coriander chutney or mint chutney. Enjoy them hot for the best taste!</li>
